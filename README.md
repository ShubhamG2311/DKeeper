# DKeeper App - Decentralized Note Keeping Application

DKeeper App is a Decentralized Note-Keeping Web Application, made using ReactJS and Motoko Programming Language, that leverages the power of the DFINITY Internet Computer Blockchain platform. This application provides users with a secure and decentralized way to manage their notes, tasks, and important information, similar to Google Keep. The DKeeper App is hosted on the Internet Computer platform, enabling users to enjoy the benefits of decentralization in various aspects of the application.

## Introduction
